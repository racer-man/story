Once upon a time a boy named Dick lived in a small village near London He was poor as his parents died when he was little.
the was treated unkindly by many villagers.One day, he overheard someone say that the streets of London were paved with gold then and there
he dicided to leave for London, he thought that people might treat him kindly if he were rich. So he left for London by foot, On the way he met a cartman,
he asked him that he was running from home, he said, "I have no proper home I am going to London the find my fortune." The cartman said, "I am going to London myself,
hop beside me and we will go to London together.". 

    Dick jumped in the cart and they travelled to London together They made to London before nightfall. Dick jumped off the cart and the carter made his way to an inn.
Dick looked around and all he could see were dirty streets with lots of unfriendly people, he said to himself, "Where os all that fine gold I heard of ?".
after a long time of seacrhing Dick made his way to an alley and slept there and hoped there would be no harm.
